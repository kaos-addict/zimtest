# Daily Journal
You can use zim a journal notebook by using the [Journal plugin](../Plugins/Journal.markdown).

If you want to mix the journal with other notes you can keep the journal pages in a separate section, like ':Journal'. Or you can configure the top level of the notebook as the place to keep journal pages.

For a dedicated journal notebook you typically want to set the preference to have the calendar embedded in the side pane.
